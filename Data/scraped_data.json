Bombay and its Department of Physics started in June 1958 in the SASMIRA ( Silk and Art Silk Manufacturing Institute Research Association ) building in Worli, Bombay. There were only two science departments in the Institute at that time. These two departments moved in 1960 to a single storey building in Powai , which was later to become the Stores Building. A spacious multi-storey building for the Physics Department became ready in 1964. During the initial stages, the Department was headed by Drs. R. P. Singh (1958-1966), B. N. Bhattacharya (1967-1968), P. P. Kane (1969-1970), and C. M. Srivastava (1971-1973). After extensive discussions in the academic bodies of the Institute, the description of Physics courses was changed from Chemical Physics to Physics, and a two year (post-B.Sc.) M. Sc. programme was initiated. Later, in 1972, a five year integrated M.Sc. was also initiated. However when the five year B. Tech. programme was replaced by a four year one, the attraction of the integrated five year programme was adversely affected and so it was terminated in 1983. However, an entirely new inter-desciplinary programme, namely B. Tech. in Engineering Physics, was developed. A few faculty members in Physics Department had to spend a lot of time and effort in order to get this programme approved in the Institute. This programme is quite popular with many able students appearing for the JEE since 1984. In 1972, as in most universities in U.S.A., a course programme of one year duration was started for Ph. D. students in their first year. Experimental research work in many areas of Physics did not become feasible for several years after the starting of the Institute on account of paucity of suitable equipment, and of institute and external funding . Further, import of badly needed items of equipment was extremely difficult and time consuming. However, research work was successfully carried out in spite of these difficulties, but unfortunately at a slower pace. Since 1991, funding levels and availability of suitable equipment have recorded substantial improvements.

This body provides a single point of contact to all the Professors and students for transferring queries, suggestions and complaints both ways. It also represent the department in institute level students\u2019 bodies like Students\u2019 Academic Council, Placement Cell and SARC. The council aims to help students in every possible manner in their academic issues, department infrastructure and facilities and help in placements and applications for higher studies. Department council also plays an integral role in providing students\u2019 feedback on various topics to department authorities for further action. Department General Secretary is a member of DUGC meetings to raise up student demands and provide students\u2019 view in policies. From other side, professors and department authorities can reach us anytime to announce an information effectively or to convey any order/message to students. Together with DAMP team, the council helps in conducting orientation sessions, talks, and academic help to students which is carried out by DAMP mentors mostly. Any student with any academic issue is advised to meet General Secretary or any other council member for suggestions and further action. Current Students CurriculumB.Tech. B.Tech.-M.Tech. M.Sc.

The programme identifies select senior students from each department to act as mentors for a set of junior students and help them cope with any academic problems they may face in the department or otherwise. The primary aim is to ensure that the weak students clear their backlogs and get their academic careers back on track. The D-AMP mentors, along with the Faculty Advisors and Department Faculty Coordinators, work towards achieving this goal through early identification and constant monitoring of the students concerned. The D-AMPs act under the supervision of the respective D-AMP Coordinators (DAMC) in consultation with the ISMP Cabinet. The D-AMP is responsible for the academic well-being of the students in the department. The coordinators and mentors are assigned certain duties and privileges to help them achieve this goal. Apart from these, the D-AMP is expected to undertake any activities or new initiatives that would be beneficial to the department, such as course mentoring, updating of documents and backlog lists, involvement and meetings with the Faculty Coordinator, Faculty Advisors and the Head of Department, etc. The DAMP Team also maintains a blog website containing various resources, course reviews, AMAs and much more.

Bombay and its Department of Physics started in June 1958 in the SASMIRA ( Silk and Art Silk Manufacturing Institute Research Association ) building in Worli, Bombay. There were only two science departments in the Institute at that time. These two departments moved in 1960 to a single storey building in Powai , which was later to become the Stores Building. A spacious multi-storey building for the Physics Department became ready in 1964. During the initial stages, the Department was headed by Drs. R. P. Singh (1958-1966), B. N. Bhattacharya (1967-1968), P. P. Kane (1969-1970), and C. M. Srivastava (1971-1973). After extensive discussions in the academic bodies of the Institute, the description of Physics courses was changed from Chemical Physics to Physics, and a two year (post-B.Sc.) M. Sc. programme was initiated. Later, in 1972, a five year integrated M.Sc. was also initiated. However when the five year B. Tech. programme was replaced by a four year one, the attraction of the integrated five year programme was adversely affected and so it was terminated in 1983. However, an entirely new inter-desciplinary programme, namely B. Tech. in Engineering Physics, was developed. A few faculty members in Physics Department had to spend a lot of time and effort in order to get this programme approved in the Institute. This programme is quite popular with many able students appearing for the JEE since 1984. In 1972, as in most universities in U.S.A., a course programme of one year duration was started for Ph. D. students in their first year. Experimental research work in many areas of Physics did not become feasible for several years after the starting of the Institute on account of paucity of suitable equipment, and of institute and external funding . Further, import of badly needed items of equipment was extremely difficult and time consuming. However, research work was successfully carried out in spite of these difficulties, but unfortunately at a slower pace. Since 1991, funding levels and availability of suitable equipment have recorded substantial improvements.

This body provides a single point of contact to all the Professors and students for transferring queries, suggestions and complaints both ways. It also represent the department in institute level students\u2019 bodies like Students\u2019 Academic Council, Placement Cell and SARC. The council aims to help students in every possible manner in their academic issues, department infrastructure and facilities and help in placements and applications for higher studies. Department council also plays an integral role in providing students\u2019 feedback on various topics to department authorities for further action. Department General Secretary is a member of DUGC meetings to raise up student demands and provide students\u2019 view in policies. From other side, professors and department authorities can reach us anytime to announce an information effectively or to convey any order/message to students. Together with DAMP team, the council helps in conducting orientation sessions, talks, and academic help to students which is carried out by DAMP mentors mostly. Any student with any academic issue is advised to meet General Secretary or any other council member for suggestions and further action. Current Students CurriculumB.Tech. B.Tech.-M.Tech. M.Sc.

The programme identifies select senior students from each department to act as mentors for a set of junior students and help them cope with any academic problems they may face in the department or otherwise. The primary aim is to ensure that the weak students clear their backlogs and get their academic careers back on track. The D-AMP mentors, along with the Faculty Advisors and Department Faculty Coordinators, work towards achieving this goal through early identification and constant monitoring of the students concerned. The D-AMPs act under the supervision of the respective D-AMP Coordinators (DAMC) in consultation with the ISMP Cabinet. The D-AMP is responsible for the academic well-being of the students in the department. The coordinators and mentors are assigned certain duties and privileges to help them achieve this goal. Apart from these, the D-AMP is expected to undertake any activities or new initiatives that would be beneficial to the department, such as course mentoring, updating of documents and backlog lists, involvement and meetings with the Faculty Coordinator, Faculty Advisors and the Head of Department, etc. The DAMP Team also maintains a blog website containing various resources, course reviews, AMAs and much more.

The image contrast in MRI which depends on the varying water concentration and local environment, often fails to produce a good signal which leads to the implementation of external contrast agents. Ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) agents such as Feridex and Resovist (commercial contrast agents) have been used as T2 MRI contrast agents due to their ability to shorten T2 relaxation times in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, by selective uptake and accumulation in the cells. However, these superparamagnetic oxides generally show relatively low R2 relaxivities since they are prepared in aqueous media and consequently have polydisperse particles with poor crystallinity. To improve the MR contrast properties, first time a group of research scholars (Jeotikanta Mohapatra, Arijit Mitra, and Himanshu Tyagi), Prof. D. Bahadur and Prof M. Aslam introduced a new concept. They modulate iron oxide nanoparticles shape to a rod shape morphology to improve the MR contrast properties. Iron oxide nanorods of sub-100 nm lengths are prepared by a simple soft-chemical approach and then functionalized using bio-compatible polymer. The polymer coated nanorods are shown as better MRI contrast agents in comparison to spherical magnetic nanoparticles. Having same volume as nanospheres, nanorods induce strong magnetic field inhomogeneity over a larger volume of protons in surroundings. The stronger de-phasing of proton moments is reflected as faster relaxation rate in T2-weighted imaging. The magnetic nanorod based contrast agent possesses excellent colloidal stability, biocompatibility and poor cytotoxicity in physiological conditions. Moreover, compared to commercial contrast agent (Ferumoxytol), the R2 relaxivity of nanorods is nearly six times higher. Animal trials using these nanorods are being carried out and we are very hopeful that our study will open interesting avenues in cancer treatment.

Existing methods for producing such pulses do not always produce the desired properties. The processes that take place inside matter are extremely short-lived, and the light pulses used to study them need to be similarly short \u2014 in the range of around 100 attoseconds (billionths of a billionth of a second). In this timespan, a light wave can undergo only a few rotations, which may not be enough to provide useful information about the material. In this work a new method for precisely characterizing such light pulses has been developed. An extremely short, high-energy and circularly polarized light pulse is fired at an atom or a solid body. Upon being absorbed, the light pulse knocks an electron out of the body. This electron, which now carries information about the light wave, can reveal clues as to the properties of the sample being examined. Because the light pulses are circularly polarized, the ejected electrons also fly off with a rotating motion. The more precisely these light pulses are characterized, the more details can be derived about the electron\u2019s place of origin within a material.

Analytical distribution of released synaptic vesicles: Binomial or not ? Analytical distribution of released synaptic vesicles: Binomial or not ? Release of synaptic vesicles carrying neurotransmitters (also called \u201cquantal content\u201d), form the basis of electrochemical signal transmissions across all synapses. For 70 years, it has been known experimentally that the statistical distribution of each such individual release is a Binomial. Yet the size of the reservoir from which these vesicles get released, fluctuates. Hence the question of the actual distribution of quantal content averaged over these fluctuations, remained open. The problem is difficult due to history dependence -- we make progress by focusing on the steady state. Our work reveals that for fixed frequency electrical input stimulation, the statistically averaged distribution is still a Binomial, while for random input stimulations the averaged distribution is generically non-Binomial. Often under physiological conditions presynaptic input signals are random. So the exact results in our paper will hopefully help in analyzing experimental distributions in such cases, and make estimates of the model parameters associated with the concerned neuron. We also compare our theory to experimental data for fixed frequency stimulation from MNTB-LSO synapses of juvenile mice. Research Highlights Hyperbolic polaritons in 2D materials ...

In this work, we show that this process is inherently efficient and uncover key universal features in homing trajectories. We use a programmable self-propelled robot executing life-like dynamics to model it as an actual living organism. We program robots with variable noise strength, quantifying their deviation from straight-line trajectories. Furthermore, the robot utilizes onboard sensors to sense light gradients, enabling it to perform homing motion towards a specific point. We find that in the case of the robot consistently correcting its course by reorienting towards home every time it pointed opposite to it, the homing time became independent of the noise beyond a critical value of noise strength, signifying an enhanced efficiency. We reproduced this phenomenon in computer simulations and developed an analytical model with key theoretical predictions. We later tested our model on trajectory data of flying pigeon flocks and found an excellent agreement with our theory. Our work provides valuable insights into the physics of homing dynamics, providing a statistical basis for its robustness across the animal kingdom.

Their study, recently published in Advanced Functional Materials, presents an innovative approach to control Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons (HPhPs) through standard optical techniques, which was previously a complex challenge. \u201cOur work overcomes the large momentum mismatch between photons and HPhPs, allowing for efficient excitation and tuning of these light waves,\u201d explains Nihar Ranjan Sahoo, the lead author of the study. This breakthrough enables the practical implementation of HPhP-based devices and opens up new possibilities for applications in areas such as mid-infrared sensing, thermal management, and sub-diffraction imaging. The mid-infrared light is critical for applications in security and there are only limited optical components available for these wavelengths. In addition to accessing previously unattainable frequency ranges, their approach allows for in-plane field measurements with both vertical and horizontal polarizations of light. \u201cThis polarization-sensitive method expands our analytical capabilities and facilitates the excitation of in-plane HPhPs,\u201d adds Prof. Anshuman Kumar. The research team's dual tuning mechanism, which combines periodicity dependence and twisting, offers precise control over the optical response, enhancing the potential for developing adaptable photonic devices. The implications of this study are vast, highlighting the versatility and potential of these advanced materials in revolutionizing photonic technology.

Bits and pieces of theoretical advances and experimental observations were put together, and many obstacles were obliterated on the way by physicists over the years, before a consistent framework emerged where everything could fit in a truly remarkable way. The Higgs boson was born as a consequence of a successful marriage of otherwise apparently disconnected ideas, solemnized by the great minds who scripted the future direction of research in particle physics paving the way towards the most expensive experiment in the history of mankind. \u00a9 2024 Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Powai, Mumbai - 400076 Phone: +91-22-25767551 Fax: +91-22-25767552 E-Mail: office@phy.iitb.ac.in Site map"
